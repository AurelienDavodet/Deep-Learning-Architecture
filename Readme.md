# 🧠 Deep Learning Architectures from Scratch

Welcome to my Deep Learning Architectures repository! This project aims to implement various deep learning models from scratch, focusing on a clear, code-first approach to understanding the fundamentals of deep learning.

Current implementations: 
- Perceptron
- MLP
- ANN

## 📜 Project Overview
In this repository, I will be implementing well-known deep learning architectures from scratch using Python. The goal is to deepen understanding by building each component manually, without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for the core calculations. This will involve constructing neural networks, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers, and more!

## 📂 Contents
Each folder in this repository will contain:

Code for a specific deep learning architecture.
Documentation explaining the model and the steps taken to implement it.
Example notebooks (where applicable) to demonstrate the functionality of the model on sample data.

### Planned Architectures
1. Simple Neural Networks
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
5. Transformers
And more...

## 🚀 Getting Started
To try out the implementations yourself, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AurelienDavodet/Deep-Learning-Architectures.git
cd Deep-Learning-Architectures
``` 
## Prerequisites
This project uses only basic Python libraries (such as NumPy), so make sure you have those installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## 🛠️ How to Use
Each implementation will have its own README or Jupyter Notebook explaining how to run it and experiment with it. For most models, you can simply run the provided scripts or cells to see the architecture in action.

## 🎯 Goals of the Project
- Educational Focus: Understanding deep learning architectures at the ground level.
- Code-First Learning: Writing and explaining each component step-by-step.
- Experimentation: Making it easy to modify and extend architectures for experimentation.

## 📈 Roadmap
As I progress, I’ll be adding new architectures and improvements to existing ones. Stay tuned for regular updates!
